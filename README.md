# *INTRODUCTION*

IN THIS PROPOSAL OUR PRIORITY WAS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE MECHANISM.

WE TOOK ADVANTAGE FO ALL THE CLUES THAT YOU GAVE US TO CREATE AN EFFICIENT AND COMPACT SYSTEM WHICH CAN WITHSTAND EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND THE GREAT FORCES APPLIED IN SPACE TRAVEL.

# *MATERIALS*

 -TITANIUM

 # *MECHANISM*
 
  ![MECHANISM](https://github.com/Marcoz08/STARMAN_PROJECT_FREEDOM/blob/main/Website/Captura%20de%20pantalla%20(119)2.png)
  
THE PROJECT MECHANISM WORKS ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF A HOUSE KNOB. THIS NEEDS TO BE IN THE CORRECT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO OPEN, OTHERWISE IT WILL KEEP CLOSED. 

WHEN WE CLOSE IT, WE CREATE A TENSION IN AN INTERNAL SPRING WHICH WILL MAINTAIN SUCH TENSION UNTIL THE MOMENT OF THE OPENING. AT THAT MOMENT THE SPRING WILL EMIT A FORCE OUTWARD ACHIEVING THAT RIGHT RELEASE OF THE PIECE, AVOIDING ANY POSSIBLE STAGING 
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A 12V DC MOTOR WHICH WILL ALLOW THE "KEY" TO ROTATE SO WE CAN OPEN OR CLOSE THE MECHANISM WHEN WE WANT

 
 # *STRUCTURE*
 
WE USE A TITANIUM ALLOY AS THE CYLINDER MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS ELEMENT IS KNOWN FOR ITS RESISTANCE TO HIGH TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS ITS INCREDIBLE STRENGTH. THIS ALLOWS US TO APPLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF FORCE WITHOUT IT SUCCUMBING. WE ALSO USE A PIANO WIRE SPRING BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS HIGH TEMPERATURES AND HAS A VERY STRONG DENSITY. THIS ALLOWS IT TO EXERT CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE ON THE OBJECT WHICH ALLOWS US TO SAFELY EJECT 100% OF THE TIME
 
#  *3D MODELS*

MODEL B, IS A OPCIONAL DEVICE THAT INCLUDES SCREW HOLDERS.

 # *PROPORTIONS*
 
SOMETHING TO HIGHLIGHT IN OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT THE PARTS ARE VERY EASY TO FIND IN A MORE COMPACT WAY SO IT CAN EVEN BE REDUCED MORE. 
THIS SAME MECHANISM CAN BE USED IF WE NEED TO CONNECT TWO OR MORE THINGS. WITH A SLIGHT MODIFICATION THIS PROJECT CAN BE ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS WHICH MAKES IT A VERY VERSATILE PIECE
 
 
#  *WHAT MAKES OUR PROPOSAL A GREAT OPTION?* 

 IT IS EXACTLY THE SHAPE, WEIGHT AND SIZE THAT NASA REQUIRES

SOMETHING AMAZING ABOUT OUR PROJECT IS ITS SCALABILITY, DESIGN AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION THAT CAN SERVE ON SATELLITES, SPACECRAFT, ROCKETS, ETC.  THE KEY IS TO SCALE THE SIZE, AS IT IS A DEVICE WITH SIMPLE COMPONENTS AND MECHANISMS, ITS SIZE CAN BE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED TO WORK ON NANOSATELLITES.  ALTERNATIVELY, THE SIZE CAN BE ENLARGED FOR USE IN LARGER SPACE MODULES THAT REQUIRE GREATER CLAMPING.



 SOMETHING ELSE THAT DEMONSTRATES THE VERSATILITY OF THE DEVICE IS ITS ABILITY TO ADJUST THE OUTPUT FORCE AT THE TIME OF EJECTION.  JUST MAKE A FEW CHANGES TO THE SPRING TO GET THE DESIRED OUTPUT THRUST.  MORE TURNS WILL GIVE AN INCREDIBLY STRONG FORCE, TRIMMING TURNS WILL REDUCE THE FORCE OUTPUT, BUT CAN BE IDEAL FOR DELICATE PARTS SUCH AS THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOLAR PANELS FROM A SATELLITE


 In conclusion:
 "It is simple, but efficient"

# *AZURE CLOUD SERVICES*

HOW DO WE USE AZURE IN OUR PROJECT?
 THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ADDING IN A FINAL VERSION A MICROCONTROLLER TO CONTROL THE ROTATION OF THE MOTOR, THE MICROCONTROLLER WOULD BE AN ESP32 WITH COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS ON THE 2.4 GHZ BAND.  THIS MICRO WILL CONNECT TO THE NETWORK LINKING WITH THE MAIN COMPUTER OF THE SHIP.  THEN, THE GROUND MISSION CONTROL WILL BE ABLE TO EJECT THE PARTS USING THE DASHBOARD PROVIDED BY THE AZURE IOT HUB.
