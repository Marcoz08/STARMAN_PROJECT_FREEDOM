# *INTRODUCTION*

IN THIS PROPOSAL OUR PRIORITY WAS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE MECHANISM.

WE TOOK ADVANTAGE FO ALL THE CLUES THAT YOU GAVE US TO CREATE AN EFFICIENT AND COMPACT SYSTEM WHICH CAN WITHSTAND EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND THE GREAT FORCES APPLIED IN SPACE TRAVEL.

# *MATERIALS*

 -Titanium

 # *MECHANISM*

THE PROJECT MECHANISM WORKS ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF A HOUSE KNOB. THIS NEEDS TO BE IN THE CORRECT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO OPEN, OTHERWISE IT WILL KEEP CLOSED. 

WHEN WE CLOSE IT, WE CREATE A TENSION IN AN INTERNAL SPRING WHICH WILL MAINTAIN SUCH TENSION UNTIL THE MOMENT OF THE OPENING. AT THAT MOMENT THE SPRING WILL EMIT A FORCE OUTWARD ACHIEVING THAT RIGHT RELEASE OF THE PIECE, AVOIDING ANY POSSIBLE STAGING 
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A 12V DC MOTOR WHICH WILL ALLOW THE "KEY" TO ROTATE SO WE CAN OPEN OR CLOSE THE MECHANISM WHEN WE WANT

  
 # *VERSION B*
 This version is wider, but works as a demostration of how we can add screws to conections.
