# *INTRODUCTION*

IN THIS PROPOSAL OUR PRIORITY WAS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE MECHANISM.

WE TOOK ADVANTAGE FO ALL THE CLUES THAT YOU GAVE US TO CREATE AN EFFICIENT AND COMPACT SYSTEM WHICH CAN WITHSTAND EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND THE GREAT FORCES APPLIED IN SPACE TRAVEL.

# *MATERIALS*

 -Titanium

 -Spring

 # *MECHANISM*
 
  ![MECHANISM](https://github.com/Marcoz08/STARMAN_PROJECT_FREEDOM/blob/main/Website/Captura%20de%20pantalla%20(119)2.png)
  
THE PROJECT MECHANISM WORKS ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF A HOUSE KNOB. THIS NEEDS TO BE IN THE CORRECT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO OPEN, OTHERWISE IT WILL KEEP CLOSED. 

WHEN WE CLOSE IT, WE CREATE A TENSION IN AN INTERNAL SPRING WHICH WILL MAINTAIN SUCH TENSION UNTIL THE MOMENT OF THE OPENING. AT THAT MOMENT THE SPRING WILL EMIT A FORCE OUTWARD ACHIEVING THAT RIGHT RELEASE OF THE PIECE, AVOIDING ANY POSSIBLE STAGING 
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A 12V DC MOTOR WHICH WILL ALLOW THE "KEY" TO ROTATE SO WE CAN OPEN OR CLOSE THE MECHANISM WHEN WE WANT

 
 # *STRUCTURE*
 
WE USE A TITANIUM ALLOY AS THE CYLINDER MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS ELEMENT IS KNOWN FOR ITS RESISTANCE TO HIGH TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS ITS INCREDIBLE STRENGTH. THIS ALLOWS US TO APPLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF FORCE WITHOUT IT SUCCUMBING. WE ALSO USE A PIANO WIRE SPRING BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS HIGH TEMPERATURES AND HAS A VERY STRONG DENSITY. THIS ALLOWS IT TO EXERT CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE ON THE OBJECT WHICH ALLOWS US TO SAFELY EJECT 100% OF THE TIME
 

 # *PROPORTIONS*
 
SOMETHING TO HIGHLIGHT IN OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT THE PARTS ARE VERY EASY TO FIND IN A MORE COMPACT WAY SO IT CAN EVEN BE REDUCED MORE. 
THIS SAME MECHANISM CAN BE USED IF WE NEED TO CONNECT TWO OR MORE THINGS. WITH A SLIGHT MODIFICATION THIS PROJECT CAN BE ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS WHICH MAKES IT A VERY VERSATILE PIECE

 # *PROJECT ESPECIFICATIONS*
  
 # *VERSION B*
 This version is wider, but works as a demostration of how we can add screws to conections.
